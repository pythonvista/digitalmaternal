            In July 2015, TAAF partnered with the FCT primary healthcare board to give safe motherhood information and mama kits to women in PHC kubwa. <br>

            Still with technical support from the FCT Primary Healthcare Board in partnership with the Kabash Love Foundation, in October 2015 we took advocacy on safe motherhood to Dakwa community in Bwari area council Abuja. We also gave mama kits to pregnant women to encourage them attend antenatal clinics. One major challenges women in low income communities face during pregnancy and childbirth is purchasing the essentials for delivery. This is one major reasons why women give birth at home instead in health centers. <br>

            In February 2016 still in partnership with the FCT Primary Health Care Board, TAAF took advocacy and support to women in Kabusa IDP camp. The FCT primary health care board gave us technical support to immunize children, gave information on water hygiene and sanitation especially in pregnancy and HIV testing and screening. Pregnant women were also given mama kits.
