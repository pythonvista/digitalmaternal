        Theodora Anavhe Adamu Foundation (TAAF) was founded in memory of Theodora Anavhe Adamu, with a vision to create a Nigeria where no woman dies during pregnancy or childbirth and where neonatal deaths are significantly reduced.<br>
        Our mission is to design inclusive and innovative programs that promote safe motherhood through advocacy, training, and awareness campaigns, ensuring that maternal, newborn, and child health remains a priority for all stakeholders.

          On December 17, 2012, our world changed forever. We had eagerly awaited the birth of our sister Theodora Anavhe Adamu’s son, only to be confronted with an unimaginable loss. Theodora suffered eclampsia, leading to severe complications that ultimately claimed her life.
Months later, in search of answers, we returned to the hospital to review her medical records—only to be told that her file was missing. A decade later, countless women, especially those in low-income communities, continue to suffer preventable maternal deaths and complications. Many, like Theodora, leave no official medical record behind.
From this profound pain, TAAF was born—a movement to advocate for stronger health systems, safe motherhood, and reproductive health rights for vulnerable women and girls in Nigeria.
