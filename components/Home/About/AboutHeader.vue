        Theodora Anavhe Adamu Foundation (TAAF) was founded in memory of Theodora Adamu.
        At TAAF we see a society with increased maternal and child life span. A Nigeria
        where women live through and after pregnancy and neonatal death is almost if not
        completely absent in the country. Our Mission is to introduce more inclusive and
        creative programs that will drive the consciousness of safe motherhood practices
        to all concerned stakeholders with view of promoting good maternal, newborn and
        child health through top level advocacy, trainings and awareness campaigns.

        <p class="xs:text-base md:text-lg">
          On the 17th of December 2012, our world took another turn from our loss. We had
          waited 8 months in excitement to welcome our sister Theodora Anavhe Adamu’s son
          only to be given a rude shock by death. Theodora had suffered eclampsia which
          led to other complications and eventually her death. Months later, to give
          closure to our pain, we went back to the hospital to get her records and find
          out what the doctor recorded as the cause of her death only to be told that her
          file couldn’t be found. 10 years later, pregnant woman especially those in low
          income communities still experience death, disabilities and loss and like the
          case of Theodora Adamu, their records get missing or omitted. Indeed, we have
          drawn strength from the deep pain and sadness her death has caused to begin to
          advocate for health systems strengthening and safe motherhood for vulnerable
          women and girls in Nigeria.
